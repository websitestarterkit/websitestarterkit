# Modern Web Standards Checklist

## HTML5

- **Semantic HTML**: Use tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to enhance semantic structuring and accessibility.
- **Form Enhancements**: Leverage new input types like `email`, `date`, `tel`, and `range` for improved form handling.
- **Video and Audio**: Embed video and audio content using `<video>` and `<audio>` tags without relying on third-party plugins.
- **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)**: Enhance accessibility by incorporating ARIA attributes for better screen reader support.
- **Custom Elements**: Create reusable, encapsulated HTML tags using Web Components and Custom Elements.

## CSS3

- **Flexbox and Grid**: Employ Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts and CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness.
- **CSS Variables**: Define and reuse values throughout stylesheets using CSS custom properties (variables).
- **CSS Filters and Blend Modes**: Apply visual effects and blend modes for enhanced design capabilities.
- **Animations**: Add CSS animations to enhance user interaction and engagement.
- **Media Queries**: Use media queries to create designs that work across various devices.
- **Transitions and Animations**: Enhance user experience with smooth transitions and meaningful animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Craft layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices using media queries and relative units.

## Web Accssibility (WCAG 2.1+)

- **Accessibility**: Ensure all content is accessible by following the latest WCAG guidelines. WCAG 2.2 is the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Make the website navigable using a keyboard alone.
- **Contrast Ratio**: Maintain sufficient contrast for readability by users with visual impairments.
- **Accessible Media**: Provide descriptive alt text for images. Provide captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content.
- **Clear Focus States**: Visually indicate which element has focus when using the keyboard.

## ECMAScript 6+

- **Let and Const**: Use `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declarations. Prefer `const` for variables that shouldn't be reassigned and `let` for block-scoped variables.
- **Arrow Functions**: Simplify function syntax with arrow functions for cleaner code and lexical `this` binding.
- **Async/Await**: Utilize async/await for handling asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner and more readable syntax than promises.
- **Modules**: Organize code into reusable modules using the `import` and `export` syntax.
- **Template Literals**: Simplify string interpolation and multi-line strings using template literals.

## Compliance Checks and Test Automation Tools

- **HTML Validator**: Validate markup using the W3C HTML Validator.
- **CSS Validator**: Ensure stylesheets adhere to standards with the W3C CSS Validator.
- **Accessibility Checker**: Audit the website for accessibility compliance using tools like axe, Wave, and `Lighthouse` (integrated in Chrome DevTools) to audit performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
- **Performance Audits**: Regularly audit and optimize website performance using tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and PageSpeed Insights.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test the website across multiple browsers and devices for compatibility and responsiveness.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing frameworks like Jest or Cypress for comprehensive testing of functionality and regressions.

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize images, minimize HTTP requests, and consider lazy loading to enhance page load speed. Split code into smaller chunks for faster initial load times using techniques like dynamic imports.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Explore PWA features for offline capability, app-like experiences, and faster loading.
- **Security**: Implement HTTPS for secure communication and follow best practices for data protection and input validation.
- **Google's Baseline Standards** Align with [Google Baseline](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/08/baseline) which provides a clear reference point for developers and site owners on whether web platform features are ready to be safely adopted across major browsers.
